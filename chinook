--We're going to work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT
FirstName,
LastName,
Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE
Country != 'USA'
ORDER BY Country

--Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT
FirstName,
LastName
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE
Country = 'Brazil'
ORDER BY LastName

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT  cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE
inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'
ORDER BY cust.LastName

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title like '%sales%agent%'

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
